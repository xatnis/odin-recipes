    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You start with rolling out pizza dough. You let it come to room temperature, then prepare the surface
    you're working on with oil and shape the dough.
    </p>
    <p>Gather all the ingredients and preheat the oven to 230 degrees C. Place warm water in a bowl and add yeast and sugar,
    you mix it and let it stand until it gets creamy, about 10 minutes. Add flour, oil and salt to the mixture and beat it
    until it's smooth. Let it rest for about 10 minutes and turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 
    12-inch circle. Transfer it to the prepared pizza pan and spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice. Bake in
    preheated oven, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven when it gets golden brown and let it cool for 5 minutes before serving.
